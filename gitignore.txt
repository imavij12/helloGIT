Mechanism how you can ignore some files of JAVA/ C+

what-> It is used to ignore files as it is not needed to be tracked.
to ignore a file 
write file's name in .gitingore


how -> It can ignore only untracked files.  untracked->ignore
Tracked files can not be ignored. tracked -> untracked -> ignore


why -> There are some redundant files which keeps creating everytime (System build files) 
so we dont want to keep it tracking. Thus we ignore
Also some secure files as well which needs to be kept secret.
So we can ignore tracking of these files.



to ignore all txt files -> *.txt
to not ignore a file -> !3.txt
to comment in .gitignore - # text

to untrack a file 
git rm --cached <filename> -> e.g.   git rm --cached 3.txt
--cached helps in ignoring file inly from github
rm only, will remove file from github as well as from staged area
